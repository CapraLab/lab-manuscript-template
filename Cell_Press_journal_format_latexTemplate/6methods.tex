\subsection{1st Methods Section}
Cell Press journals use STAR methods (\url{https://www.cell.com/star-authors-guide}). One can format these methods ahead of time but this formatting can also wait until acceptance/revisions as most Cell Press journals do not require formatting for initial submissions.

\subsection{Data and Code Availability}
Identify original data sources and provide links to software in this section.
