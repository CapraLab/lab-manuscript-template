\section{INTRODUCTION}
\introTips % Delete when no longer needed
Introductions for Cell Press journal articles  should not include any subsections. A quick note about citations: they should occur in the form of superscript numbers, numbered in order of appearance\supercite{enardIntraInterspecificVariation2002,kingEvolutionTwoLevels1975,sholtisGeneRegulationOrigins2010}. Use the \texttt{supercite} command immediately after the relevant text to write citations using the citation keys from the .bib file. You can also explicitly refer to the author(s)/paper using the following convention: ``Enard et al.\supercite{enardIntraInterspecificVariation2002} quantified gene expression in four primate species''. Cell Press Journals use journal abbreviations in the References section. If you export a .bib file from a reference manager (e.g., Mendeley, Zotero), ensure that journal abbreviations are invoked. Abbreviated components of the journal title should also include a period (see the Sholtis et al. 2010 reference below, Trends in Genetics $\rightarrow$ Trends Genet.). These can be added manually in your reference management software library or code can be added in the 0main.tex file to do this automatically.

\textbf{First paragraph(s)} What is the problem? Why do we care?  First sentence can be a general truth or general limitation that your audience accepts. E.g., \textit{While differences between archaic and modern humans are well described, there is a poor understanding of the genetic mechanisms underlying such phenotypic differences.} or  \textit{Most aspects of archaic hominin biology cannot be directly studied due to their lack of preservation in fossils.} Don't waste the first sentence with a definition.

\textbf{Middle paragraph(s)} What have others found about this specific problem? What are the current hypotheses and support for each? and/or what data have been previously analyzed? What are the gaps? E.g., \textit{One such mechanism may be alternative splicing, but we cannot obtain such data from extinct taxa.} This part of the Intro may require a few paragraphs, but you do not need to fully review the history of work on the question. Focus on the current state of the field.

\textbf{Last paragraph} Overview of the major questions addressed here and why they are important. \textit{Here, we investigated X using dataset Y and dataset Z. We tested the A hypothesis. We also considered this other obscure hypothesis. We predicted x, y, and z.} E.g., \textit{Here, we leverage a new deep neural network that can predict splice altering variants from sequence alone to examine such variants in archaic hominins.}
